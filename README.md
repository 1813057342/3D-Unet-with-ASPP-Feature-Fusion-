The multi-channel time-frequency microseismic data is converted to the time-frequency domain by using S transform, a three-dimensional time-frequency volume is constructed, 
and then the creat-5D-data.m file is loaded to construct the training data set. After the training set is constructed, the 3D-tfdl.m file is loaded for training.
